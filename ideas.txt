Improvements to Consider:

    Add Functional Testing:
        Implement unit tests for your JavaScript logic, especially for pagination, filtering, and sorting functionalities. This ensures your features work as expected after updates.

    Enhanced Error Handling:
        Include error handling for scenarios like:
            Adding duplicate entries.
            Dealing with large input sizes for text fields.
            Displaying user-friendly messages if localStorage isn't available.

    Media Queries for Improved Responsiveness:
        Fine-tune the CSS to ensure your app looks great on smaller devices like tablets or smartphones. For instance:
            Stack the Search and Saved Quotes sections vertically instead of side by side on smaller screens.
            Optimize table width and align text appropriately.
    
    Accessibility Enhancements:
        Add aria-label attributes for buttons and interactive elements.
        Ensure proper keyboard navigation and focus indicators for all elements.
    
    Add a "No Results Found" Message:
        When the search filter or pagination results in no quotes, display a user-friendly message like "No quotes found."
    
    Add Export/Import Functionality:
        Allow users to export their saved quotes as a JSON file and re-import them. This would be helpful for backups and portability.
    
    Additional Styles for Visual Impact:
        Add animations for transitions between editing and viewing modes.
        Use a gradient overlay on your background image for a more polished effect.
    
    Dynamic Navigation Indicator:
        Add a visual cue (like page numbers or indicators) in the pagination section to show the current page and total pages.
    
    Licensing and Documentation:
        Ensure you include a LICENSE.txt file in the root directory with the MIT License text.
        Create a README.md file explaining:
            The purpose of the project.
            How to use it.
            Acknowledgments for assets like the background image and icons.
    
    Deploy the Application:
        Deploy your application using GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel to make it accessible online. This way, others can easily see your work.
    
    Expand Features:
        Tagging System: Add a feature for users to tag their quotes with categories.
        Favorite Quotes: Allow users to mark quotes as favorites and filter them separately.
    
    Form Validation Enhancements:
        Add real-time validation for input fields (e.g., show an error immediately if a required field is left blank).
    
    Make Use of Service Workers:
        Introduce a service worker to enable offline access, so users can interact with their quotes even without an internet connection.
