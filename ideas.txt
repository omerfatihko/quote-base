Improvements to Consider:

    Add Functional Testing:
        Implement unit tests for your JavaScript logic, especially for pagination, filtering, and sorting functionalities. This ensures your features work as expected after updates.
    
    Add Export/Import Functionality:
        Allow users to export their saved quotes as a JSON file and re-import them. This would be helpful for backups and portability.
    
    Licensing and Documentation:
        Create a README.md file explaining:
            The purpose of the project.
            How to use it.
            Acknowledgments for assets like the background image and icons.
    
    Deploy the Application:
        Deploy your application using GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel to make it accessible online. This way, others can easily see your work.
    
    Expand Features:
        Tagging System: Add a feature for users to tag their quotes with categories.
        Favorite Quotes: Allow users to mark quotes as favorites and filter them separately.
    
    Form Validation Enhancements:
        Add real-time validation for input fields (e.g., show an error immediately if a required field is left blank).
    
    Make Use of Service Workers:
        Introduce a service worker to enable offline access, so users can interact with their quotes even without an internet connection.
    
    Optimize Performance: 
        If you have a lot of quotes, consider lazy loading or virtual scrolling for the table.

    Accessibility: 
        Add ARIA attributes to improve accessibility for users with assistive technologies.
